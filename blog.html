            <p>
                In this section I learnt to model physical systems that depend on time. One such behaviour can be modelled using Unforced ODES which is a 
                ODE that is homogenous. Homogenous means that all the terms of the equation involve the dependant variable on the left hand side ie. (right hand side = 0).
                Solving Unforced ODES leads to 4 different types of Solutions: Overdamping ( 2 real Roots), Critical Damping (Equal real Roots),
                Underdamping (Complex Roots), No Damping  (Imaginary Root). Another such behaviour can be modelled using Forced ODES which is a 
                ODE that is non-homogenous. Solving these ODE involves adding the particular integral solution which is the forcing term on the right hand side of the equation
                to the complementary function solution which is the left hand side of the equation similar to solving the Unforced ODE. We then learned numerical methods 
                for first order ODE using the euler method and the improved euler methods. The final topic of this module was learning how to implement Laplace Transforms
                to solve ODE. Laplace Transforms  are very useful in investigating the transient behaviour of time varying systems and it is used in many Electrical Engineering 
                Problems.
